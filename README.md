# Page Replacement
The page replacement algorithms decide which page to be replaced in case of page faults.<br><br>

### A) FIFO -First In First Out -
This algorithm simply replace the first page that was allocated in the memory frames<br>
### B) Optimal
This algorithm doesn't exist in real life, but it is the best we can reach, so it is used to measure performance of another algorithm<br>
### C) LRU -Least Recently Used -
This algorithm replace the page that have been accessed in the past few requests<br>
### D) Clock
This algorithm is also called second chance algorithm, it replace the candidate page for removal based on a round robin way
